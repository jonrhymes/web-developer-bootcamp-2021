Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. Given the signal received by Earth as a string, s, determine how many letters of the SOS message have been changed by radiation.

Example s = 'SOSTOT'

The original message was SOSSOS. Two of the message's characters were changed in transit.
